A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of deep-rooted, ancient strength — the peaceful certainty of someone who has grown roots so deep that no storm can topple her. Her eyes carry the wisdom of sustained growth across decades, her half-smile reflecting the quiet joy of someone whose daily routines have become the trunk of a life that branches into everything beautiful. There is timelessness in her gaze, the look of a woman built to endure and flourish. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a magnificent golden tree — roots deep and extensive, trunk strong and textured, branches reaching in every direction, leaves glowing with warm amber light. Deep midnight blue background with stars visible through the branches. Photorealistic style.
