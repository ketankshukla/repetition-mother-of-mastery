# Chapter 41 Summary: Repetition in Business and Entrepreneurship

## Core Argument
The principles of mastery — deliberate practice, habit formation, feedback loops, and the compound effect — apply to professional success with the same force they apply to athletic performance and artistic creation.

## Key Points
- Business success is built through iteration — the repeated cycle of creating, testing, measuring, learning, and improving
- The lean startup methodology is essentially deliberate practice formalized for business
- Sales mastery is built through thousands of purposeful sales conversations — each one a repetition that strengthens persuasion and rapport skills
- Leadership is a practiced skill, not an innate quality — communication, decision-making, and inspiration improve through deliberate repetition
- Innovation is produced by iterative repetition, not single flashes of insight — Edison tested 1,000+ filaments; Dyson built 5,000+ prototypes
- The compound effect in business: 10 daily sales calls = 2,500/year; 30 min daily strategic reflection = 180 hours/year
- Mastery-oriented business culture: invest in training, create feedback systems, celebrate consistency, encourage experimentation, model mastery

## One-Line Takeaway
The boardroom is a practice room — business success is built through the same relentless, purposeful repetition that produces mastery in every other domain.
