# Chapter 44 Summary: Long-Term Growth — Maintaining Momentum Across Decades

## Core Argument
Mastery is measured in decades — maintaining momentum requires periodizing growth, evolving practice, sustaining intrinsic motivation, and learning to love the plateau.

## Key Points
- Periodization of growth: cycle through growth phases (intensive), consolidation phases (moderate), and renewal phases (recovery)
- Evolve your practice as skill increases: seek new challenges, deepen rather than broaden, study the masters, seek new teachers
- Protect intrinsic motivation: reconnect with enjoyment, explore new dimensions, create flow opportunities, guard against external pressures
- In the long-term journey, plateaus become the dominant experience — redefine your relationship with improvement
- Find satisfaction in subtle refinements rather than dramatic leaps
- Legacy thinking shifts perspective from short-term to long-term, providing motivation immune to daily fluctuations
- The practitioners who complete the decades-long journey achieve the deepest, most profound levels of mastery

## One-Line Takeaway
Mastery is measured in decades — periodize your growth, evolve your practice, embrace the plateau, and let time and persistence create the mastery that only decades can produce.
