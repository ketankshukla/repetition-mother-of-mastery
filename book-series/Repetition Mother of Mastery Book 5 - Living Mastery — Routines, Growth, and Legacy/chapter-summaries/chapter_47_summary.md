# Chapter 47 Summary: Creating a Legacy of Mastery

## Core Argument
Legacy extends your mastery beyond your lifetime through four dimensions — teaching, creating works, establishing standards, and building institutions — and it requires the generosity to share what you have learned without reservation.

## Key Points
- Four dimensions of legacy: teaching/mentoring, creating works, establishing standards, building institutions
- Legacy requires generosity — the master who hoards knowledge creates no legacy; the master who shares freely multiplies their impact
- Generosity is self-reinforcing: teaching deepens understanding, mentoring refines skills, contributing strengthens commitment
- Document your journey: writing, recording, curriculum development, deep mentoring relationships
- The ripple effect: your impact extends far beyond the people you directly influence — students teach students, works inspire creators
- You will never see the full extent of your legacy — but you can trust that it exists
- Begin your legacy now — don't wait until the end of your career; every act of contribution is a seed

## One-Line Takeaway
Your mastery is valuable — but the legacy you create from it, extending your impact through teaching, works, standards, and institutions, is priceless.
