# Dedication

*To Nimisha Acharya —*

*You showed me that mastery is not about talent.*
*It is about the quiet, relentless commitment to showing up,*
*doing the work, and trusting the process.*

*Every repetition in my life has been made richer*
*because you were beside me.*

*This series is for you.*
