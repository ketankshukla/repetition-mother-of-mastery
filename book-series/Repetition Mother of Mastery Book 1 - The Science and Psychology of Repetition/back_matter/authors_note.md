# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Foundation of Mastery*.

This book began with a frustration that had been building for years — watching people abandon their pursuits because they believed they lacked talent. The myth of innate genius is one of the most destructive ideas in human history, and I wanted to dismantle it with the one thing it cannot withstand: evidence.

What you have just read is the scientific foundation for everything that follows in this series. Neural pathways. Myelin. Neuroplasticity. Deliberate practice. The spacing effect. Feedback loops. These are not abstract concepts — they are the machinery of mastery, and they belong to everyone.

The next book — *The Habit Engine* — takes this science and turns it into systems you can build into your daily life. Because understanding how mastery works is only the beginning. Building the habits that make it inevitable — that is where the real work starts.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
