# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Repetition: Mother of Mastery* series, the *Reality Without Belief* series, and the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* fiction series. He writes about mastery, reality, and the stubborn refusal to accept borrowed answers when direct experience is available.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the best non-fiction changes how you think, and the best fiction changes how you feel — and that both require the same commitment: say something true, and say it well.
