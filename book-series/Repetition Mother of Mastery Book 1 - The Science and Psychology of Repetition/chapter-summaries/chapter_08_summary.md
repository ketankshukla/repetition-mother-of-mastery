# Chapter 8 Summary: The Spacing Effect — Why Timing Changes Everything

## Core Argument
Distributing practice across time produces dramatically better results than cramming — the spacing effect is one of the most robust findings in learning science and changes how you should structure all practice.

## Key Points
- First documented by Ebbinghaus in 1885 and confirmed by hundreds of studies across every learning domain
- Spaced practice forces the brain to work harder to retrieve partially faded memories, triggering stronger consolidation
- Practice that feels harder (spaced) produces better learning than practice that feels easier (massed)
- The forgetting curve shows memories decay predictably, but each spaced review flattens the curve
- Optimal spacing schedules review material just before it is about to be forgotten, maximizing consolidation with minimum repetitions
- Spaced repetition systems (Anki, Quizlet) automate optimal spacing for memorization tasks
- The spacing effect applies equally to motor skills — distributed physical practice outperforms marathon sessions
- Interleaving — mixing different skills within a session — produces more flexible and adaptable skills than blocked practice
- 30 minutes of daily practice produces better results than 3 hours of weekly practice

## One-Line Takeaway
Spread your practice across time — your brain learns more from six short sessions than one long marathon.
