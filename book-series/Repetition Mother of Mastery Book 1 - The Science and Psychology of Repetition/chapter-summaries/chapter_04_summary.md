# Chapter 4 Summary: Neuroplasticity — Your Brain's Infinite Capacity to Grow

## Core Argument
Neuroplasticity — the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life — means that mastery is available to everyone, at every age, in every domain.

## Key Points
- The old "fixed brain" model — that the adult brain cannot change — has been definitively disproven
- London taxi driver studies showed that years of navigation physically enlarged the hippocampus — practice changed brain structure
- Experience-dependent plasticity is driven by repetition: repeated practice produces dramatic, lasting brain changes
- The use-it-or-lose-it principle means unused pathways weaken while practiced pathways strengthen
- Neuroplasticity operates across the entire lifespan — adults who take up new skills show measurable brain changes within weeks
- You are the architect of your own brain — every practice session is a construction project building your neural infrastructure
- Neuroplasticity provides the scientific foundation for Carol Dweck's growth mindset
- Consistent practice, focused attention, embracing challenge, and patience are the keys to harnessing neuroplasticity

## One-Line Takeaway
Your brain is designed to grow and change throughout your entire life — the only requirement is purposeful, repeated practice.
