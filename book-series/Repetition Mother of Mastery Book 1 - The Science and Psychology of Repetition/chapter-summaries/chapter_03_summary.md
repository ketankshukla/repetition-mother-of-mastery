# Chapter 3 Summary: Myelination — The Biology of Skill

## Core Argument
Myelin — a fatty substance that wraps around neural pathways — is the biological mechanism that transforms clumsy beginners into effortless experts, and it is built exclusively through repeated practice.

## Key Points
- Myelin insulates neural axons, increasing signal speed by up to 50x and dramatically improving precision
- Oligodendrocytes detect repeated neural activity and respond by wrapping layers of myelin around the active pathways
- Myelination is cumulative — more practice means more myelin, which means faster and more precise performance
- The myelin response is strongest with focused attention, error correction, and progressive challenge
- Mistakes followed by correction are among the most powerful drivers of myelination
- What looks like "talent" in expert performers is actually heavily myelinated neural circuits built through years of practice
- Every human brain has oligodendrocytes ready to produce myelin — the capacity for mastery is a biological birthright
- Myelination continues throughout life, meaning it is never too late to build new skills

## One-Line Takeaway
Myelin is the bridge between practice and mastery — built one repetition at a time, available to every human brain.
