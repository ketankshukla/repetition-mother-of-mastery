A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression conveys the awe of scientific discovery — eyes bright with fascination, brow slightly lifted, the look of someone witnessing the extraordinary architecture of the human brain for the first time and understanding that this magnificent machinery was built to be shaped by repetition. There is reverence and power in her gaze. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a photorealistic cross-section of a human brain rendered in luminous gold and warm amber tones, with visible neural pathways glowing like fiber optic cables and layers of myelin as shimmering white sheaths. Deep black background with subtle blue atmospheric haze. Cinematic lighting with volumetric rays.
