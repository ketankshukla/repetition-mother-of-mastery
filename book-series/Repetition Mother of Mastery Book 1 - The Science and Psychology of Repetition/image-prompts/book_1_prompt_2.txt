A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of awakened understanding — her eyes wide with the clarity of someone who has glimpsed the infinite pattern beneath all skill, the mathematical beauty of how every repetition spirals upward into something greater. There is intellectual fire in her gaze, tempered by the humility of knowing how much further the spiral extends. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a golden Fibonacci spiral radiates outward, composed of thousands of tiny luminous particles suggesting neural connections. Deep navy blue background with warm golden light emanating from the spiral. Photorealistic style with cinematic lighting.
