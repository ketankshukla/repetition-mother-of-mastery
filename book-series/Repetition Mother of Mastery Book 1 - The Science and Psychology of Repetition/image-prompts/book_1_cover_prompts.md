Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, white.

## Prompt 2: The Infinite Spiral
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A golden Fibonacci spiral radiates outward from the center of the image, each layer representing a repetition building upon the last. The spiral is composed of thousands of tiny luminous particles that suggest neural connections. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s reaches toward the center of the spiral with an inspiring look of determination and breakthrough, her hand touching the brightest point. Deep navy blue background with warm golden light emanating from the spiral. Photorealistic style with cinematic lighting. Title "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, gold on dark background. Subtitle "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" below in smaller Garamond, white. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, gold.

## Prompt 3: Brain Architecture
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A photorealistic cross-section of a human brain rendered in luminous gold and warm amber tones, with visible neural pathways glowing like fiber optic cables. Layers of myelin are visible as shimmering white sheaths around the brightest pathways. The brain floats against a deep black background with subtle blue atmospheric haze. The image conveys power, precision, and the extraordinary beauty of the brain's architecture. Cinematic lighting with volumetric rays. Title "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white with gold accents.

## Prompt 4: The Practitioner
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s sits at a grand piano in a dramatically lit room, her fingers poised above the keys with an expression of focused mastery and quiet confidence. Golden light streams from above, illuminating her hands and face while the rest of the room fades into shadow. Subtle glowing neural pathway patterns are visible in the air around her hands, suggesting the invisible science of practice. Photorealistic style, warm color palette of gold, amber, and deep brown. Title "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, gold. Subtitle "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" below in smaller Garamond, cream colored. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, gold.

## Prompt 5: The Key
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A single ornate golden key floats in the center of the image, glowing with warm inner light. The key is composed of intricate neural pathway patterns — dendrites and axons forming the teeth and shaft of the key. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s stands behind the key, slightly out of focus, reaching toward it with an expression of awe and determination. The background transitions from deep midnight blue at the edges to warm gold at the center. Photorealistic style with dramatic cinematic lighting and subtle lens flare. Title "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white. Subtitle "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" below in smaller Garamond, light gold. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, white.
