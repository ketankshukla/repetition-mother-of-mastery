PROMPT 1 - Neural Pathway Illumination

A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her eyes are closed in a moment of profound inner revelation, her expression carrying the wonder of someone who has just discovered the hidden architecture of mastery — the invisible science that explains why repetition transforms the human brain. Her lips part slightly as if absorbing a truth that changes everything. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a luminous network of glowing golden neural pathways extends outward like a constellation, symbolizing the brain rewiring itself through repetition. The background is deep midnight blue fading to black. Dramatic cinematic lighting from above creates a halo effect. Photorealistic style.
