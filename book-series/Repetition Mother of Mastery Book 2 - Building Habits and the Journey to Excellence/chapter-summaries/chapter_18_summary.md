# Chapter 18 Summary: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

## Core Argument
Extrinsic motivation burns hot and fast but dies quickly; intrinsic motivation — driven by autonomy, competence, and relatedness — provides the sustainable fire that carries you through a lifetime of practice.

## Key Points
- Extrinsic motivation (rewards, praise, status) is powerful short-term but unsustainable long-term
- The overjustification effect: external rewards can actually undermine intrinsic enjoyment of an activity
- Intrinsic motivation comes from the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself — it does not depend on external conditions
- Self-Determination Theory identifies three drivers: autonomy (control), competence (effectiveness), relatedness (connection)
- Finding intrinsic fire: connect practice to values, find joy in the process, cultivate curiosity, pursue mastery for its own sake
- Create autonomy by giving yourself choices in what, when, and how you practice
- Build competence through tracking that makes improvement visible
- Satisfy relatedness by connecting with a community of fellow practitioners
- Think of extrinsic motivation as kindling (starts fast, burns out) and intrinsic as the log (slow to ignite, burns for hours)

## One-Line Takeaway
Find the fire within — intrinsic motivation sustained by autonomy, competence, and connection is the only fire that lasts a lifetime.
