# Chapter 14 Summary: Environmental Design

## Core Argument
Your physical environment shapes your behavior more powerfully than your willpower — restructuring your surroundings to reduce friction for practice and increase friction for distraction makes consistent practice automatic.

## Key Points
- Research shows environmental cues exert powerful, often unconscious influence on behavior
- Reducing friction: keep practice materials visible and accessible, prepare your space in advance, create a dedicated practice area
- Adding friction: remove phones from practice space, block distracting websites, control auditory environment
- Each step removed from the path to practice dramatically increases the likelihood of practicing
- Each step added to the path of distraction dramatically decreases the likelihood of succumbing
- Choice architecture: design your environment so practice is the default, the path of least resistance
- Environmental design reinforces practitioner identity — walking into a practice-designed space makes you feel like a practitioner
- Environmental optimization is ongoing — continuously observe, experiment, and refine

## One-Line Takeaway
Design your environment for practice, and let the surroundings do the heavy lifting that willpower cannot sustain.
