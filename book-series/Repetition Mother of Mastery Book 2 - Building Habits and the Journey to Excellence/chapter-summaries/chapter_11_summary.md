# Chapter 11 Summary: The Habit Loop — Cue, Routine, Reward

## Core Argument
Every habit follows a neurological loop — cue, routine, reward — that, once established, operates automatically without willpower or conscious decision-making, making it the key mechanism for building sustainable daily practice.

## Key Points
- The habit loop was discovered through MIT research on the basal ganglia, which encodes repeated behaviors as automatic sequences
- The cue is the trigger (time, location, preceding action) that initiates the habit — it can be deliberately chosen and engineered
- The routine is the practice behavior itself — it must be specific and consistent for the basal ganglia to encode it
- The reward closes the loop and must be immediate and satisfying to drive repetition
- Habit stacking — linking new habits to existing ones — is one of the most effective cue strategies
- As the loop cycles repeatedly, the brain develops a craving that makes the cue increasingly powerful
- The first few weeks are critical — every execution strengthens the craving, every skip weakens it
- Common mistakes: starting too big, inconsistent cues, delayed rewards, relying on motivation

## One-Line Takeaway
Engineer the cue-routine-reward loop, and practice becomes as automatic as brushing your teeth.
