# Chapter 12 Summary: Starting Small — The Power of Micro-Habits

## Core Argument
Starting with an impossibly small commitment — one push-up, one sentence, one minute — bypasses psychological resistance and builds the momentum that naturally expands into substantial daily practice.

## Key Points
- Micro-habits eliminate resistance by making the commitment so small the brain cannot generate a credible objection
- Once you start, momentum takes over — the brain's task-completion mechanisms carry you far beyond the micro-commitment
- James Clear's Two-Minute Rule: scale any new habit down until it takes two minutes or less
- Micro-habits drive identity shifts — each tiny completion reinforces "I am someone who practices"
- Small wins trigger dopamine release, reinforcing the habit loop and sustaining motivation
- The compound effect transforms tiny daily actions into massive long-term results
- Never go below the micro-habit minimum — on worst days, do the minimum to keep the streak alive
- The streak itself becomes a powerful motivator — "don't break the chain"

## One-Line Takeaway
Start so small that failure is impossible, and let momentum transform the tiny into the extraordinary.
