# Chapter 13 Summary: Consistency Over Intensity

## Core Argument
Daily moderate effort produces dramatically better results than sporadic intense effort because the brain's cumulative neural adaptation is optimized by regular, evenly spaced practice sessions.

## Key Points
- Neural adaptation is cumulative — each session builds on consolidated gains from the previous one
- Sporadic practice allows neural changes to decay during long gaps between sessions
- Seven 30-minute sessions produce far more improvement than one 3.5-hour session despite equal total time
- The compound effect: tiny daily improvements accumulate into transformative long-term results
- Intense sessions produce diminishing returns after 60-90 minutes of focused practice
- Marathon sessions increase burnout risk and deplete motivation for future sessions
- The most important thing on any given day is simply showing up — maintaining the habit loop
- Strategies: lower the bar on bad days, schedule fixed practice times, protect practice time, track consistency, forgive imperfect sessions

## One-Line Takeaway
Show up every day — consistency is the single most important variable in the mastery equation.
