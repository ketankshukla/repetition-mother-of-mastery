A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of commanding precision — the steady, focused gaze of someone who has engineered her own transformation, who understands the exact mechanics of cue, routine, and reward, and who has built an internal engine that runs with the smooth certainty of interlocking gears. There is mechanical confidence in her eyes, the look of a woman who has become her own architect. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a magnificent set of interlocking golden gears and cogs, each representing a component of the habit system. The gears are in motion, turning smoothly and powerfully. Deep charcoal background with subtle mechanical texture. Photorealistic style.
