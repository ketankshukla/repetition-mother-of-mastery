# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Cognitive Edge*.

This book was about working smarter, not just harder. Active recall — the single most powerful learning technique ever discovered — produces two to three times more retention than passive review. Interleaved practice. The teaching effect. Self-assessment. These are the techniques that separate good learners from extraordinary ones.

The chapter on overcoming boredom was personal. Anyone who has pursued mastery knows that the path includes long stretches where practice feels monotonous, where progress feels invisible, where the temptation to quit whispers louder than the commitment to continue. The strategies in that chapter are the ones I use myself.

The final book — *Living Mastery* — weaves everything together into a complete philosophy of living. Mastery is not just a skill. It is a way of life.

With gratitude,
