# A Quick Favor

If you found *The Cognitive Edge* valuable, would you consider leaving a review on Amazon?

Reviews are the single most important thing you can do to support an independent author. They help other readers discover the series, and they help me keep writing the books you want to read.

Even a single sentence makes a difference:

> *"This book changed how I think about..."*

Thank you for reading. Thank you for reviewing. And thank you for being part of this journey.
