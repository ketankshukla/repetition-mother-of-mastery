# Chapter 37 Summary: Self-Assessment — Becoming Your Own Best Coach

## Core Argument
The ability to accurately assess your own performance — overcoming inherent cognitive biases — transforms every practice session into a coaching session and is one of the most valuable skills for sustained mastery.

## Key Points
- Self-assessment is challenging due to Dunning-Kruger effect, confirmation bias, recency bias, and emotional interference
- Development strategies: establish clear criteria, record and review performances, compare to models of excellence
- Additional strategies: use structured self-reflection, calibrate against external feedback, develop domain-specific perceptual skills
- The self-coaching framework: Plan (before) → Monitor (during) → Evaluate (after) → Audit (periodically)
- Honesty is the most important quality — inaccurate self-assessment leads to misdirected practice
- Multi-pass review of recordings: first for overall flow, second for technical accuracy, third for expression and nuance
- The internal coach — real-time self-assessment during performance — is a hallmark of mastery, built through thousands of hours of deliberate self-evaluation
- Self-assessment improves with repetition like any other skill

## One-Line Takeaway
Develop the honesty and skill to assess your own performance accurately — become your own best coach, and every practice session becomes a coaching session.
