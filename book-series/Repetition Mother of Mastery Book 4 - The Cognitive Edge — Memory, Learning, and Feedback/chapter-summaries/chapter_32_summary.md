# Chapter 32 Summary: Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval — The Three Pillars of Retention

## Core Argument
Memory consists of three distinct processes — encoding, storage, and retrieval — each with its own mechanisms and optimization strategies; failure at any stage produces the same result: you cannot remember.

## Key Points
- **Encoding** depends on attention, depth of processing, elaboration, organization, and dual coding
- Shallow processing (surface features) produces weak memories; deep processing (meaning, connections) produces strong ones
- **Storage** depends on consolidation (primarily during sleep) and resistance to interference
- Proactive and retroactive interference can degrade stored memories; repetition strengthens memories against interference
- Reconsolidation: retrieved memories become temporarily unstable, creating opportunities for strengthening
- **Retrieval** depends on retrieval cues — context-dependent and state-dependent factors affect accessibility
- The retrieval practice effect: the act of retrieval itself strengthens the memory, making future retrieval easier
- Optimize all three pillars: encode deeply with full attention, store through spaced consolidation, retrieve actively and frequently

## One-Line Takeaway
Memory is three processes — encoding, storage, and retrieval — and optimizing all three through repetition produces memories that are deeply encoded, securely stored, and reliably accessible.
