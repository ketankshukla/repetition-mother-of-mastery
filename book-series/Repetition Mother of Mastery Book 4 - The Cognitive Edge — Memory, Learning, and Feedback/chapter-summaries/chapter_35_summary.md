# Chapter 35 Summary: The Teaching Effect

## Core Argument
Teaching material to others forces deeper cognitive processing — generative processing, organization, error detection, and retrieval practice — that accelerates the teacher's own mastery beyond what personal study alone can achieve.

## Key Points
- Teaching forces you to discover and fill gaps in understanding that passive learning tolerates
- Mechanisms: generative processing, organizational structuring, anticipating questions, error detection, retrieval practice
- Nestojko study: students who merely expected to teach showed significantly better retention than those expecting a test
- Peer tutoring research: tutors benefit as much as or more than the students they tutor
- You don't need an actual student — use the Feynman Technique, teach an imaginary student, create instructional content, or explain to a rubber duck
- The teaching paradox: the effect is often strongest for learners still developing understanding, not just experts
- Teaching + practice creates a virtuous cycle: practice deepens skill, teaching deepens understanding, each enhances the other
- The highest-level masters are almost always teachers — teaching is both a product and a driver of mastery

## One-Line Takeaway
Teach what you learn — explaining to others forces the deep processing that transforms surface knowledge into genuine mastery.
