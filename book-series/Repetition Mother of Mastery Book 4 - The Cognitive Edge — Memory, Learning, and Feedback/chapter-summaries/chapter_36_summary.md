# Chapter 36 Summary: The Role of Feedback — How Correction Creates Excellence

## Core Argument
Feedback multiplies the effectiveness of every repetition by ensuring each one is targeted, corrective, and progressive — transforming practice from a blind process into a precision-guided path to excellence.

## Key Points
- The feedback-learning connection is multiplicative, not additive — feedback compounds improvement across thousands of repetitions
- Five characteristics of effective feedback: specific, timely, actionable, balanced, and calibrated to the learner's level
- The feedback sandwich has limitations — learners discount the padding; honest, specific, forward-looking feedback is more effective
- Self-generated feedback requires three skills: perceptual sensitivity, analytical ability, and corrective creativity
- The feedback loop in practice: perform → assess → adjust → repeat → iterate
- Technology-enhanced feedback: video recording, audio recording, wearable sensors, software applications
- Practice without feedback is practice in the dark — you may reinforce errors for years without knowing
- Use every feedback source available: coaches, technology, self-assessment, peers

## One-Line Takeaway
Feedback transforms repetition from a blind process into a precision instrument — seek it relentlessly, apply it immediately, and let it guide every repetition toward excellence.
