# Chapter 33 Summary: Active Recall — The Most Powerful Learning Technique Ever Discovered

## Core Argument
Active recall — deliberately retrieving information from memory without looking at the source — produces two to three times more retention than any passive review strategy, making it the single most powerful learning technique ever validated by science.

## Key Points
- Active recall works through the retrieval practice effect: retrieval itself strengthens memory, not just re-exposure
- Rereading creates an illusion of familiarity that is mistaken for knowledge; active recall builds actual retrievability
- Karpicke & Blunt study: retrieval practice group remembered 50% more than the group that read four times
- Meta-analysis of 200+ studies confirms "large and robust effects on long-term retention"
- Implementation methods: flashcards, blank page method, self-quizzing, Feynman Technique, practice testing, closed-book practice
- Active recall is a "desirable difficulty" — it feels harder but produces dramatically better results
- When practice feels easy, be suspicious — easy practice often means re-encoding rather than retrieving
- Active recall applies to skill-based practice too: perform from memory whenever possible

## One-Line Takeaway
Test yourself instead of rereading — active recall is the most powerful learning technique ever discovered, and it works for every skill and every subject.
