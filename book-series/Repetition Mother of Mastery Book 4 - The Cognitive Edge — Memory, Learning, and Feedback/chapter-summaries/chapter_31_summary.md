# Chapter 31 Summary: Repetition and Memory — How the Brain Stores What Matters

## Core Argument
Your brain stores what it encounters repeatedly and discards what it encounters once — repetition is the primary signal that tells the brain which information is worth keeping.

## Key Points
- Memory formation is a multi-stage process: sensory memory (milliseconds), working memory (seconds), long-term memory (permanent)
- Transfer from working memory to long-term memory requires consolidation, which is driven primarily by repetition
- Repetition strengthens memory through synaptic strengthening, multiple encoding pathways, consolidation reinforcement, and emotional tagging
- Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve: without repetition, 90% of learned material is forgotten within one week
- Each spaced repetition flattens the forgetting curve, making memories progressively more durable
- Four types of long-term memory: declarative (facts), procedural (skills), episodic (experiences), semantic (general knowledge)
- Practical strategies: space repetitions, vary contexts, engage emotionally, sleep after practice, test yourself

## One-Line Takeaway
Your brain keeps what you repeat and discards what you don't — repetition is the master signal for memory formation.
