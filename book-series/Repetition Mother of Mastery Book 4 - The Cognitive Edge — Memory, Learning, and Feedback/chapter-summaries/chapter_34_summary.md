# Chapter 34 Summary: Interleaved Practice — Why Mixing It Up Beats Drilling Down

## Core Argument
Interleaved practice — mixing different skills within a practice session — produces dramatically better long-term retention and more flexible skill application than blocked practice, despite feeling less productive during the session.

## Key Points
- Rohrer & Taylor study: interleaved group scored 76% vs. blocked group's 38% on delayed test — despite performing worse during practice
- Interleaving works through discrimination learning (identifying which skill to apply), retrieval practice, contextual interference, and within-session spacing
- Blocked practice creates an illusion of learning through short-term priming that fades quickly
- How you feel during practice is not a reliable indicator of how much you are learning
- Implementation: mix different skills within sessions, randomize order, resist the temptation to block, combine with active recall
- Blocked practice is appropriate for initial skill acquisition (cognitive stage); switch to interleaving for refinement and retention
- The interleaving mindset: value challenging, effortful practice over smooth, comfortable practice

## One-Line Takeaway
Mix it up — interleaved practice feels harder but produces learning that is more flexible, more durable, and more transferable than drilling one skill at a time.
