# Chapter 34: Interleaved Practice — Why Mixing It Up Beats Drilling Down

There is a practice strategy that feels productive, looks efficient, and produces satisfying short-term results. It is called blocked practice — the approach of practicing one skill, one topic, or one type of problem repeatedly until you feel you have mastered it before moving on to the next. Blocked practice is the default approach in most classrooms, most training programs, and most self-directed learning. It is intuitive, organized, and comfortable.

It is also significantly less effective than the alternative.

The alternative is interleaved practice — the approach of mixing different skills, topics, or problem types within a single practice session rather than practicing each one in isolation. Interleaved practice feels harder, looks messier, and produces less satisfying short-term results. But it produces dramatically better long-term retention, more flexible skill application, and faster development of the discriminative abilities that characterize expert performance.

This is one of the most important and most counterintuitive findings in the science of learning. And understanding it will transform how you structure every practice session for the rest of your life.

## The Research

The evidence for interleaved practice is extensive and consistent.

In a classic study by Doug Rohrer and Kelli Taylor, students practiced solving math problems using either blocked practice (all problems of one type, then all problems of another type) or interleaved practice (problems of different types mixed together in random order). During practice, the blocked group performed better — they solved problems faster and with fewer errors. But on a test one week later, the interleaved group scored seventy-six percent compared to the blocked group's thirty-eight percent. The interleaved group retained twice as much, despite performing worse during practice.

This pattern — worse performance during practice but better performance on delayed tests — has been replicated across dozens of studies and multiple domains. In painting, students who practiced different painting techniques in interleaved fashion produced better work on a delayed assessment than students who practiced each technique in a separate block. In sports, athletes who practiced different skills in interleaved fashion showed greater improvement on game-day performance than athletes who practiced each skill in isolation. In music, students who practiced different pieces in interleaved fashion retained more and performed better than students who practiced each piece in a separate block.

## Why Interleaving Works

Interleaved practice produces superior long-term results through several interconnected mechanisms.

**Discrimination learning.** When you practice one skill in isolation, you do not need to discriminate between different skills — you already know which skill to apply because you are only practicing one. But in real-world performance, a critical component of expertise is the ability to identify which skill, technique, or approach is appropriate for a given situation. Interleaved practice forces you to make this discrimination with every repetition — to identify the type of problem, select the appropriate strategy, and apply it correctly. This discrimination practice builds the pattern recognition and decision-making abilities that characterize expert performance.

**Retrieval practice.** Interleaving naturally incorporates active recall. When you switch from practicing skill A to practicing skill B and then back to skill A, you must retrieve the motor program or knowledge associated with skill A from memory each time you return to it. This repeated retrieval strengthens the memory in the same way that active recall does — through the retrieval practice effect discussed in the previous chapter.

**Contextual interference.** Interleaving creates what researchers call "contextual interference" — the cognitive disruption that occurs when you switch between different tasks or skills. This interference makes practice harder and slower, but it forces deeper cognitive processing. The brain must work harder to encode, store, and retrieve each skill when it is practiced in the context of other, competing skills. And this deeper processing produces stronger, more durable, and more flexible learning.

**Spacing within sessions.** Interleaving naturally spaces the practice of each individual skill within a session. Instead of practicing skill A twenty times in a row, you practice it five times, interspersed with practice of skills B, C, and D. This within-session spacing produces the same benefits as between-session spacing — stronger consolidation, better long-term retention, and more durable skill development.

## The Illusion of Blocked Practice

Blocked practice creates a powerful illusion of learning. When you practice one skill repeatedly, your performance improves rapidly within the practice session. You solve problems faster. You execute techniques more smoothly. You feel confident and competent. This rapid within-session improvement feels like learning — and it is deeply satisfying.

But the improvement is largely an artifact of short-term priming rather than long-term learning. The skill is temporarily activated in working memory, making it easy to access and execute. But this temporary activation does not produce the deep encoding, the strong consolidation, or the robust retrieval pathways that long-term retention requires. When the priming fades — when you move on to other activities and return to the skill days or weeks later — much of the apparent improvement has disappeared.

Interleaved practice does not produce this illusion. Performance during interleaved practice is slower, more error-prone, and less satisfying. But the learning is deeper, more durable, and more transferable. The effort of switching between skills, discriminating between approaches, and retrieving each skill from memory produces the deep processing that blocked practice bypasses.

This is a critical insight: how you feel during practice is not a reliable indicator of how much you are learning. Practice that feels easy and productive may be producing less learning than practice that feels hard and frustrating. Trust the science, not the feeling.

## How to Implement Interleaved Practice

**Mix different skills within each practice session.** Instead of dedicating an entire session to one skill, divide the session into segments and practice different skills in each segment. A musician might alternate between scales, sight-reading, and repertoire practice. An athlete might alternate between different techniques or drills. A student might alternate between different types of problems or different subjects.

**Randomize the order.** The more unpredictable the sequence, the stronger the contextual interference and the greater the learning benefit. Instead of practicing skills A, B, C in a fixed rotation, randomize the order — B, A, C, A, B, C, A — so that you never know which skill is coming next.

**Resist the temptation to block.** When interleaved practice feels frustrating — when you feel like you are not making progress because you keep switching between skills — resist the temptation to revert to blocked practice. The frustration is the learning. The difficulty is the mechanism. Trust the process.

**Combine with active recall.** Interleaved practice naturally incorporates active recall, but you can amplify the effect by deliberately testing yourself on each skill before practicing it. Before playing a piece, try to recall the key passages from memory. Before solving a problem, try to recall the relevant formula or technique. Before executing a technique, try to recall the key steps without looking at a reference.

**Use interleaving for review.** When reviewing previously learned material, interleave the review rather than reviewing each topic in sequence. Mix vocabulary from different chapters. Alternate between different types of problems. Shuffle your flashcards so that cards from different topics appear in random order.

## When Blocked Practice Is Appropriate

Interleaved practice is not always superior to blocked practice. In the very early stages of learning a new skill — when you are still in the cognitive stage and need to understand the basic mechanics — blocked practice can be more effective. Practicing a brand-new skill in isolation allows you to focus your attention on the fundamentals without the additional cognitive load of switching between skills.

The optimal approach is to use blocked practice for initial skill acquisition — practicing a new skill in isolation until you have a basic understanding of the mechanics — and then switch to interleaved practice for skill refinement and long-term retention. This transition from blocked to interleaved practice mirrors the natural progression from the cognitive stage to the associative and autonomous stages of motor learning.

## The Interleaving Mindset

Interleaved practice requires a mindset shift — from valuing smooth, comfortable practice to valuing challenging, effortful practice. It requires the willingness to feel less competent during practice in exchange for being more competent during performance. It requires the discipline to trust the science over the feeling — to persist with a strategy that feels less productive because you know it produces better results.

This mindset shift is not easy. But it is one of the most valuable cognitive edges you can develop. The practitioners who embrace interleaved practice — who structure their sessions for maximum contextual interference rather than maximum comfort — develop skills that are more flexible, more durable, and more transferable than those developed through blocked practice.

Mix it up. Embrace the difficulty. And let interleaving do what the science says it does — produce learning that lasts.

In the next chapter, we explore another powerful accelerant of mastery — the teaching effect, and why explaining what you know to others is one of the fastest paths to deepening your own understanding.
