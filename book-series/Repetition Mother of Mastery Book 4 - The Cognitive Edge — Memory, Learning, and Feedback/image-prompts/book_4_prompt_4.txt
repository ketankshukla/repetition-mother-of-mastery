A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of analytical precision and focused intelligence — one eye slightly narrowed as if examining something at molecular detail, her gaze carrying the exacting scrutiny of someone who has learned to see what others miss. There is scientific rigor in her look — the face of someone who understands that feedback is the engine of accelerated growth and who examines her own learning with the precision of a master scientist. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, a gold-rimmed magnifying glass through which a complex neural network is visible in extraordinary detail — individual synapses, myelin sheaths, neurotransmitter molecules glowing with warm amber light. Dark background with dramatic side lighting. Photorealistic style. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt. Directly below, "BOOK IV" in Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.2em, font size 12pt.
