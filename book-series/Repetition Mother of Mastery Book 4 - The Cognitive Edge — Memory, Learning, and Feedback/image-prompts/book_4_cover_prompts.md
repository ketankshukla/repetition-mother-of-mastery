## Prompt 1: The Neural Network Mind
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s in profile view, eyes closed in deep concentration. Her head is transparent, revealing a luminous network of golden neural connections inside her brain — synapses firing, pathways glowing, the architecture of mastery made visible. Data streams and memory fragments float around her head like orbiting particles. Deep midnight blue background with warm golden light emanating from within her mind. Photorealistic style with dramatic cinematic lighting. Title "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, gold. Subtitle "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" below in smaller Garamond, white. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, gold.

## Prompt 2: The Sharpened Mind
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A luminous golden blade — sharp, precise, gleaming — floats vertically in the center of the image, its edge so fine it seems to cut through the darkness. The blade is composed of intricate neural pathway patterns rather than metal, suggesting that the edge is cognitive rather than physical. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s stands behind the blade, one hand reaching toward it with an expression of focused determination. Deep black background with subtle blue atmospheric glow. Photorealistic style with dramatic lighting that catches the blade's edge. Title "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white. Subtitle "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" below in smaller Garamond, light gold. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, white.

## Prompt 3: The Library of the Mind
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. An infinite library stretches into the distance — shelves upon shelves of glowing golden books representing stored memories and knowledge. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s stands at the center, pulling a luminous book from a shelf with an expression of discovery and intellectual power. Golden light streams from the open book, illuminating her face. The library fades into warm amber haze in the distance. Photorealistic style with volumetric lighting and atmospheric depth. Title "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, gold on dark background. Subtitle "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" below in smaller Garamond, cream. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, gold.

## Prompt 4: The Precision Instrument
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s holds a magnifying glass up to her eye, through which a complex neural network is visible in extraordinary detail — individual synapses, myelin sheaths, neurotransmitter molecules. The magnifying glass is rimmed in gold, and the neural details glow with warm amber light. Her expression is one of intense focus and analytical precision. Dark background with dramatic side lighting. Photorealistic style. Title "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white with gold accents. Subtitle "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" below in smaller Garamond, light gold. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, white.

## Prompt 5: The Chess Master's Mind
A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s sits at a chess board, but instead of chess pieces, the board holds luminous golden symbols representing cognitive techniques — a brain for memory, a question mark for active recall, interlocking gears for interleaved practice, a speech bubble for teaching. She contemplates the board with an expression of strategic brilliance, one hand poised to make a move. Warm golden light illuminates the board from below, casting dramatic shadows upward. Deep charcoal background. Photorealistic style. Title "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" at the top in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, gold. Subtitle "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" below in smaller Garamond, white. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, gold.
