A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her eyes are closed in deep concentration, her expression one of extraordinary cognitive depth — the serene intensity of a mind processing, encoding, retrieving, and strengthening memories at a level most people never reach. Her face radiates the quiet power of someone who has learned how the brain stores what matters and has harnessed that knowledge to remember everything that counts. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, her head appears partially transparent, revealing a luminous network of golden neural connections — synapses firing, pathways glowing. Data streams and memory fragments float around her head like orbiting particles. Deep midnight blue background with warm golden light emanating from within her mind. Photorealistic style with dramatic cinematic lighting. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt.
