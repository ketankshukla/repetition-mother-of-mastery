# Chapter 27 Summary: Language Acquisition — How Repetition Builds Fluency

## Core Argument
Language fluency is built through massive, sustained repetitive exposure and practice — the same mechanism by which children acquire their first language and the most effective approach for adult learners.

## Key Points
- Children learn language through thousands of repetitive exposures, not through explicit instruction — this is the model for all language learning
- Language engages complex neural systems: Wernicke's area (comprehension), Broca's area (production), memory systems, and auditory cortex
- Vocabulary requires 7-17 encounters with a word for reliable long-term retention, spaced across time in varied contexts
- Active production (speaking, writing) strengthens retention more than passive recognition (listening, reading)
- Grammar is learned primarily through implicit pattern recognition from repeated exposure, not explicit rule memorization
- Pronunciation requires motor learning — building new motor programs for sounds that don't exist in your native language
- Fluency is automaticity — achieved through thousands of hours of repetitive use that transfers processing from conscious to automatic systems
- Strategies: immerse yourself, speak from day one, use spaced repetition, practice in varied contexts, be patient

## One-Line Takeaway
Every fluent speaker on earth achieved fluency through the same mechanism — massive, sustained, repetitive exposure and practice.
