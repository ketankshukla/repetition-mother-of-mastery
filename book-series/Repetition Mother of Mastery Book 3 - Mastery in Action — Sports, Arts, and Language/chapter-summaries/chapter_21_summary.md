# Chapter 21 Summary: Repetition in Sports — How Athletes Achieve Peak Performance

## Core Argument
Every elite athletic performance is built on a foundation of massive, purposeful repetition — the thousands of hours of training that produce the physical and mental adaptations required for peak performance.

## Key Points
- Serena Williams hit ~1 million practice serves; Michael Phelps swam ~50 miles/week; Kobe Bryant made 800 shots per practice session
- Athletic repetition produces motor unit recruitment refinement, intermuscular coordination, and proprioceptive enhancement
- Mental benefits include pressure inoculation, confidence through demonstrated competence, and accelerated decision-making through pattern recognition
- Periodization structures training into cycles with specific goals, intensities, and recovery periods
- Progressive overload gradually increases demands to continue stimulating adaptation
- Recovery is essential — adaptations occur during rest, not during training itself
- The principle is universal across all sports: elite performance = massive purposeful repetition

## One-Line Takeaway
Behind every "effortless" athletic performance are thousands of hours of repetitive practice that built the neural and physical infrastructure of excellence.
