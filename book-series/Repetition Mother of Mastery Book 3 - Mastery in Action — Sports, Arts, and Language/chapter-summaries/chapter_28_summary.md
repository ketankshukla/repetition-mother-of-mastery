# Chapter 28 Summary: Spaced Repetition Systems

## Core Argument
Spaced repetition systems automate the spacing effect — the most powerful learning principle ever discovered — making it possible to learn and retain massive volumes of information with extraordinary efficiency.

## Key Points
- SRS algorithms schedule reviews at optimal intervals: successful recall extends the interval; failed recall shortens it
- SRS reduces total review time by 50-90% compared to traditional study methods
- Major systems: Anki (free, flexible), SuperMemo (most sophisticated algorithm), Quizlet (user-friendly), Memrise (gamified)
- Effective flashcard design: keep cards simple, use cloze deletions, include context and audio, add images, review both directions
- A disciplined user can reliably retain 5,000-8,000 vocabulary words per year
- The compound effect: 15-30 minutes of daily reviews produces extraordinary cumulative results over months and years
- Applications extend beyond language: medical students, law students, engineers, musicians all benefit
- SRS automates what the brain already wants to do — review at optimal intervals for maximum retention

## One-Line Takeaway
Spaced repetition systems are the most efficient learning technology ever created — automating the spacing effect to maximize retention in minimum time.
