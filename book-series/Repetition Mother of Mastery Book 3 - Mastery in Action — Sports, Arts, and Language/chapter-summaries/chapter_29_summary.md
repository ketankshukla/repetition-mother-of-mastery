# Chapter 29 Summary: Active vs. Passive Repetition

## Core Argument
Active engagement — speaking, writing, recalling, producing — activates deeper neural systems and produces two to three times more improvement than passive exposure for the same time invested.

## Key Points
- Passive exposure activates receptive systems shallowly; active engagement activates productive, executive, and memory systems deeply
- The testing effect: actively recalling information strengthens retrieval pathways far more than passively reviewing it
- Recognition (seeing a word and knowing it) and recall (producing a word from memory) are different cognitive processes requiring separate practice
- Merrill Swain's Output Hypothesis: producing language forces deeper processing than comprehension alone
- Passive activities: background listening, reading subtitles in native language, reviewing lists without testing
- Active activities: speaking with native speakers, writing, self-testing, transcribing, summarizing, thinking in target language
- Strategies: speak from day one, write daily, use active recall, summarize consumed content, shadow native speakers, think in target language
- Every active repetition is worth approximately three passive ones

## One-Line Takeaway
Engage actively — speak, write, recall, produce — because active repetition builds mastery three times faster than passive exposure.
