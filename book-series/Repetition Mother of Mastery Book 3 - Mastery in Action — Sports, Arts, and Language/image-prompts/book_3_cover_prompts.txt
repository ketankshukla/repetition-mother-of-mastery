PROMPT 1 - The Triple Domain

A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of expansive, multi-dimensional confidence — the radiant look of someone who has proven that mastery in one domain unlocks mastery in all domains, whose body knows the athlete's precision, whose soul knows the artist's fire, whose mind knows the linguist's fluency. Her eyes carry the breadth of someone who contains multitudes. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, three overlapping golden circles form a Venn diagram representing sports, arts, and language. Where all three overlap, brilliant white light radiates outward.
