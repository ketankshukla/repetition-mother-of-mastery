A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression carries the profound satisfaction of cross-domain mastery — the serene, knowing look of someone whose hands can grip a basketball with an athlete's precision, play a piano with an artist's soul, and write calligraphy with a linguist's fluency. Her eyes reflect the extraordinary discovery that mastery transfers — that excellence in one domain unlocks excellence in all others. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, three pairs of hands arranged vertically — gripping a basketball, playing a piano, writing calligraphy — each illuminated by warm golden light against a deep black background, connected by subtle golden neural pathway patterns. Photorealistic style with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt.
