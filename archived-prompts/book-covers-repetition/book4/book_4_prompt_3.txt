A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of boundless intellectual curiosity — eyes wide with the hunger of a mind that has discovered how to encode, store, and retrieve knowledge with extraordinary efficiency. There is wonder and command in her gaze simultaneously — the look of someone who has unlocked the library of her own mind and now moves through its infinite shelves with the confidence of a master librarian. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, identical golden books stand upright in perfectly repeating rows that stretch into infinite perspective — the same book duplicated thousands of times, shelf after shelf, row after row, each copy glowing with warm amber light, representing every time a memory was encoded, retrieved, and strengthened through the act of repetition. The rows fade into warm amber haze in the distance. Photorealistic style with volumetric lighting and atmospheric depth. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt.
