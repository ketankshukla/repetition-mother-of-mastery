A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of creative ecstasy — eyes blazing with the white-hot inspiration of someone in the grip of artistic genius, lips parted in the breathless moment where vision becomes reality. Her face carries the wild, beautiful intensity of someone whose thousands of hours of creative repetition have erupted into something that transcends technique and becomes pure art. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, the same golden brushstroke is repeated hundreds of times in a radiating pattern — identical strokes fanning outward from a central point, each one a perfect copy of the last, creating a stunning mandala of creative repetition where the same practiced motion, performed again and again, becomes something breathtakingly beautiful. Dark studio background with dramatic spotlight. Photorealistic style. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt.
