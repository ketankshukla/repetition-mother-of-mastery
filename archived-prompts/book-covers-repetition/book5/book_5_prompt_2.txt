A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her expression is one of deep-rooted, ancient strength — the peaceful certainty of someone who has grown roots so deep that no storm can topple her. Her eyes carry the wisdom of sustained growth across decades, her half-smile reflecting the quiet joy of someone whose daily routines have become the trunk of a life that branches into everything beautiful. There is timelessness in her gaze, the look of a woman built to endure and flourish. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, identical golden tree rings are visible in a cross-section pattern — ring after ring after ring repeating outward from a central point, each ring the same width and glow, representing one year of repeated growth, one cycle of seasons honored through practice, the visible record of a life built by doing the same thing beautifully, over and over. Deep midnight blue background with stars visible at the edges. Photorealistic style.
