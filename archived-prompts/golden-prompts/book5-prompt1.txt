A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She gazes upward and slightly to the left with a warm, transcendent smile — the profound peace of someone who has integrated mastery into every dimension of her life, who no longer practices to achieve but practices because practice itself has become a way of living. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, curved in a smile of deep fulfillment and transcendent peace. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Both hands are raised gently at her sides, palms upward, as if receiving the golden light descending from the tree of life above her.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE GOLDEN TREE OF LIFE:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a majestic, awe-inspiring Tree of Life rendered entirely in luminous gold — the ultimate visual metaphor for a life built through daily repetition, growing from simple roots into a magnificent canopy of legacy. The tree's trunk rises from the bottom center of the image, thick and powerful, its bark textured with thousands of identical concentric growth rings — each ring representing a year of consistent practice, the same circular pattern repeating outward from the core. The trunk splits into major branches that spread across the upper two-thirds of the image, and each major branch subdivides into smaller branches, which subdivide again and again in a perfect fractal pattern — the same Y-shaped branching structure repeating at every scale, from the massive primary limbs down to the finest golden twigs. Each branch is identical in its branching pattern to every other — the same angle, the same proportions — creating a visual symphony of self-similar repetition. The leaves are thousands of identical small golden flames — each leaf the same teardrop shape, the same warm amber glow, each one flickering with the same gentle rhythm. Some leaves are brilliant gold (active practices), others are deep amber (foundational habits), and a few at the very tips are white-gold (new growth, new skills being integrated). Golden light emanates from within the tree itself, as if the trunk contains a furnace of accumulated wisdom. At the roots, which are partially visible at the bottom of the image, the same branching pattern repeats downward — identical root structures mirroring the branches above, visualizing how daily routines anchor the entire structure. Tiny golden seeds drift from the canopy — each seed identical, each one carrying the potential for a new tree — visualizing the legacy of mastery passed to others. The deep black background is dotted with distant golden stars arranged in repeating geometric constellations. Warm volumetric light streams through the canopy, creating cathedral-like god-rays between the branches.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 5 (~28% from top): "Routines, Growth, and Legacy" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, transcendent, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of standing beneath a tree that took a lifetime of daily repetition to grow — each branch a habit, each leaf a practice session, the entire structure a testament to the power of showing up every single day. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
