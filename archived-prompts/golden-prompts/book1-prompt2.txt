A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She gazes upward and slightly to the left with a warm, luminous smile — gentle and full of wonder, as if she has just understood how the brain physically reshapes itself through repetition. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, parted in that gentle smile of reverent wonder. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Her right hand is raised, fingers gently extended, as if touching the edge of a glowing synaptic spark above her.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — MYELIN HIGHWAY:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a breathtaking visualization of myelination — the biological process of building skill. Thousands of parallel axon fibers stretch vertically from the bottom of the image upward into infinity, each one sheathed in perfectly uniform segments of translucent golden myelin — identical capsule shapes repeating along every fiber in perfect spacing, like golden pearls strung on infinite threads. The myelin sheaths glow with warm internal bioluminescence, each segment radiating the same soft amber light. Between the sheaths, the Nodes of Ranvier appear as tiny gaps where electrical signals leap — depicted as bright white-gold sparks jumping from node to node in rapid succession, the same spark pattern repeating endlessly along every fiber. The axon fibers converge and diverge like the strings of a vast cosmic harp, creating a sense of infinite parallel pathways all being strengthened simultaneously. Scattered among the fibers, cross-sectional views of individual axons reveal the concentric rings of myelin wrapping — perfect golden spirals, each wrap identical to the last, building layer upon layer of insulation. The entire scene is bathed in deep navy-black darkness with warm golden volumetric light streaming from above, illuminating the myelin structures like a cathedral of biology. Tiny floating golden particles drift through the scene like neurons in suspension.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK I" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" and "OF" are rendered noticeably smaller than "FOUNDATION" and "MASTERY." "MASTERY" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE FOUNDATION OF"
Line 4: "MASTERY"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, awe-inspiring, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of witnessing the biological miracle of how practice physically wraps each neural fiber in gold, building speed and skill one repetition at a time. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
