A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She gazes upward and slightly to the left with a warm, serene smile — the peaceful confidence of someone who knows that small daily actions compound into extraordinary results. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, curved in a smile that conveys both patience and inner fire. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Her right hand is extended upward, palm open, as if receiving the golden spiral energy descending from above.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE INFINITE SPIRAL OF COMPOUND GROWTH:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a breathtaking golden spiral — a visual metaphor for the compound effect of daily habits. A vast logarithmic spiral rendered in luminous gold begins tight and small near the center of the image, then expands outward in ever-larger arcs that fill the upper two-thirds of the frame. The spiral is not a simple line but a pathway — a golden road made of thousands of identical stepping stones, each stone a small, glowing golden disc, perfectly uniform, each one representing a single day of consistent practice. The stones nearest the center are dim and small — the humble beginnings — but as the spiral expands outward, each stone grows fractionally brighter and larger than the last, visualizing the compound effect where tiny daily improvements accumulate into staggering transformation. Along the spiral pathway, identical golden milestones appear at regular intervals — small pillars of light marking consistent progress. The spaces between the spiral arms are filled with a constellation of tiny golden points — each point identical, arranged in precise repeating geometric patterns that echo the Fibonacci sequence found throughout nature. Golden light emanates from the spiral's expanding outer edge, growing more intense as the spiral widens — the accelerating returns of sustained effort. The deep black background provides dramatic contrast, with subtle warm amber atmospheric haze. Volumetric golden rays radiate outward along the spiral's path, creating a sense of irresistible momentum. Fine golden particles and light motes drift throughout the scene.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK II" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE HABIT ENGINE" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" is rendered noticeably smaller than "HABIT" and "ENGINE." "ENGINE" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE HABIT"
Line 4: "ENGINE"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "Building Habits and the Journey to Excellence" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, awe-inspiring, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of witnessing the mathematical beauty of compound growth — how one small habit, repeated daily, spirals outward into a life of extraordinary achievement. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
