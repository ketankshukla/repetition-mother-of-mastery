A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She gazes upward and slightly to the left with a warm, penetrating smile — the sharp clarity of someone who has unlocked the secrets of memory itself, who understands that the right kind of repetition doesn't just build skill but carves knowledge permanently into the architecture of the mind. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, curved in a smile of intellectual triumph. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Her right hand is raised, index finger lightly touching her temple, as if activating the memory palace within.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE CRYSTAL MEMORY PALACE:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a breathtaking visualization of the human memory system — a vast, luminous memory palace rendered in gold and crystal. An impossibly grand architectural interior stretches upward into the top two-thirds of the image — soaring golden columns and arches forming an infinite corridor of knowledge, each column identical to the last, repeating in perfect perspective toward a vanishing point of brilliant golden light. The columns are translucent, and within each one, thousands of tiny golden symbols, equations, words, and images are stored — visible through the crystalline surface like specimens preserved in amber. Each column contains the same organizational structure — identical shelves, identical compartments, identical golden frames — the repeating architecture of systematic memory storage. The vaulted ceiling is covered in an intricate mosaic of identical golden tiles — each tile a perfect square containing a single symbol, the same tile pattern repeating endlessly in every direction, creating a sense of infinite organized knowledge. Floating between the columns, luminous golden orbs drift in precise geometric patterns — each orb identical in size and luminosity, each one containing a different piece of stored knowledge visible as a tiny golden hologram within. The orbs follow repeating orbital paths, some moving in tight circles (active recall), others in wide ellipses (spaced repetition intervals). Golden light beams connect certain orbs to others — feedback loops visualized as streams of golden light that travel from one knowledge node to another, strengthening the connections with each pass. The deep black background is visible through the gaps in the architecture, with subtle warm amber and violet atmospheric haze. Volumetric golden light pours through the arches, creating cathedral-like god-rays that illuminate the memory palace with sacred grandeur.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK IV" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE COGNITIVE EDGE" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" is rendered noticeably smaller than "COGNITIVE" and "EDGE." "EDGE" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE COGNITIVE"
Line 4: "EDGE"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "Memory, Learning, and Feedback" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, intellectually grand, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of standing inside the infinite architecture of human memory — a palace built by repetition, where every piece of knowledge has its place and every retrieval strengthens the structure. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
