A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She is looking upward and slightly to the left with a warm, radiant smile — not a grin, but a gentle, awe-filled smile of someone witnessing the extraordinary architecture of the human brain for the first time. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, parted in that gentle smile of reverent wonder. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Her right hand reaches upward toward the neural tree above her.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the neural tree background and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — NEURAL ARCHITECTURE:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background is a staggering architectural visualization of repetition: a vast cross-section of a human brain rendered in luminous gold and warm amber, but every neural pathway within the brain is depicted as an endless repeating pattern — the same Y-shaped dendrite branching structure duplicated thousands of times, each branch identical to the last, creating a fractal forest of neural repetition. Along the major axon highways, identical myelin sheath segments repeat in perfect uniform spacing like railroad ties stretching to infinity — the same white-gold capsule shape duplicated hundreds of times along each pathway. At the synaptic junctions, tiny identical golden sparks fire in synchronized bursts, each spark a perfect copy of every other spark, creating a visual staccato of repetitive neural firing. Surrounding the brain structure, concentric rings of identical neurotransmitter molecules — each one the same molecular shape rendered in translucent gold — orbit in repeating circular paths, like planets in identical orbits. The entire neural landscape pulses with warm bioluminescent light against a deep black background with subtle blue atmospheric haze. Volumetric golden rays stream through the neural architecture, catching on the repeated structures and creating a cathedral-like sense of sacred repetition. A luminous neural tree structure rises from her outstretched hand upward into the top half of the image. Tiny golden particles and sparks float throughout the scene.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK I" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" and "OF" are rendered noticeably smaller than "FOUNDATION" and "MASTERY." "MASTERY" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE FOUNDATION OF"
Line 4: "MASTERY"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, awe-inspiring, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of standing at the threshold of understanding the magnificent machinery of the human brain. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
