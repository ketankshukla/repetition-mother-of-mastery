A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She gazes upward and slightly to the left with a warm, resolute smile — the expression of someone who has built discipline into her bones, who no longer relies on motivation because her systems carry her forward automatically. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, curved in a smile of earned confidence. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Her right hand reaches upward toward the chain above her, fingers almost touching the lowest link.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE UNBREAKABLE CHAIN OF CONSISTENCY:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a magnificent, towering chain of golden links stretching from the bottom of the image upward into infinity — a visual metaphor for the unbreakable power of daily consistency. Each chain link is identical: a perfectly formed, thick golden ring with a polished surface that catches and reflects warm amber light. The links interlock in a perfectly repeating pattern — the same shape, the same size, the same golden luster, one after another after another, stretching upward without end. The chain is not a single strand but branches into multiple chains at various points, creating a tree-like structure of interconnected habit chains — morning routines linking to evening routines, small habits connecting to larger disciplines, all bound together in golden unity. Some links glow brighter than others — the anchor habits, the keystone practices that hold the entire structure together. At the points where chains connect, brilliant golden sparks radiate outward, each spark identical, representing the moment a habit clicks into automatic. Around the main chain structure, smaller chains orbit in elliptical paths — dozens of identical golden links forming perfect circles and loops, visualizing the cue-routine-reward cycle repeating endlessly. The deep black background provides dramatic contrast, with subtle warm bronze atmospheric haze. Volumetric golden light streams from above, illuminating each link so it glows with internal warmth. Fine golden dust and metallic particles drift throughout the scene, catching the light like floating embers.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK II" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE HABIT ENGINE" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" is rendered noticeably smaller than "HABIT" and "ENGINE." "ENGINE" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE HABIT"
Line 4: "ENGINE"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "Building Habits and the Journey to Excellence" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, powerful, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of forging an unbreakable chain — each day another link, each link identical in its commitment, the chain growing stronger and longer until no force on earth can break it. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
