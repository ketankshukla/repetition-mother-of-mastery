A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She looks upward and slightly to the left with a warm, knowing smile — the expression of someone who has just grasped that neuroplasticity means the brain never stops growing, that mastery is available at any age. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, parted in that gentle smile of reverent wonder. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold. Both her hands are gently raised at chest level, palms slightly upward, as if cradling an invisible orb of golden light.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — NEUROPLASTICITY LANDSCAPE:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts an awe-inspiring visualization of neuroplasticity — the brain's infinite capacity to rewire itself. A vast, luminous neural network stretches across the entire background, rendered as thousands of interconnected golden nodes — each node a tiny glowing sphere of warm amber light connected to its neighbors by fine golden filaments. The network is alive and actively growing: at dozens of points throughout the network, new connections are visibly forming — thin golden threads extending outward from existing nodes, reaching toward neighboring nodes, the tips glowing white-hot as new synapses are born in real time. Some connections are thick and bright — well-established pathways strengthened by repetition — while others are thin, faint, newly forming, still fragile. The network is not static but pulsing, with waves of golden light traveling along the established pathways in rhythmic patterns, each wave identical to the last, visualizing the repeating electrical signals of practiced skill. In the upper portion of the image, the network becomes increasingly dense and luminous, suggesting the extraordinary complexity that repetition builds over time — a golden galaxy of interconnected intelligence. The deep black background provides dramatic contrast, with subtle deep blue atmospheric haze and volumetric golden rays streaming diagonally from the upper left, illuminating the network like sunlight through a cathedral window. Tiny golden particles float throughout like neural dust catching the light.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED, DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

Line 1 (top of image, ~3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (directly below Line 1, ~7% from top): "BOOK I" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold decorative rules/lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, ~10-25% from top): "THE FOUNDATION OF MASTERY" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" and "OF" are rendered noticeably smaller than "FOUNDATION" and "MASTERY." "MASTERY" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE FOUNDATION OF"
Line 4: "MASTERY"

Line 5 (~28% from top): "The Science and Psychology of Repetition" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color, properly spaced below the title.

Line 6 (bottom of image, ~92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, awe-inspiring, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of witnessing the brain's miraculous ability to physically reshape itself — new connections forming, old ones strengthening — all driven by the sacred act of repetition. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
