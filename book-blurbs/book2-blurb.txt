Knowing why repetition works is not enough. You must build it into the fabric of your daily life -- automatically, reliably, and permanently.

The Habit Engine takes the groundbreaking science from Book 1 and transforms it into a practical system for making consistent practice inevitable rather than aspirational. You'll master the habit loop that drives all habitual behavior. You'll discover why starting impossibly small creates unstoppable momentum. Why consistency beats intensity every time. And why building systems beats relying on willpower.

You'll learn to design your environment so that practice becomes the path of least resistance, break through the plateaus that stop most people cold, and build discipline that doesn't depend on how you feel.

This is where understanding becomes practice. Build the engine, and let the habits carry you to mastery.
