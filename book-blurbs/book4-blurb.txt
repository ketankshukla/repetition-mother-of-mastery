Most people practice hard. The masters practice smart. The difference is not effort -- it is technique.

The Cognitive Edge reveals the advanced cognitive techniques that separate the fastest learners from the rest. You'll discover active recall -- the single most powerful learning technique ever discovered, producing two to three times more retention than rereading. Interleaved practice -- the counterintuitive finding that mixing skills produces dramatically better long-term results. And the specific feedback strategies that make every hour of practice a more powerful investment.

You'll learn to become your own best coach, overcome the boredom that kills most practice routines, and harness modern tools that supercharge the ancient principles of repetitive practice.

Practice hard. But more importantly, practice smart.
