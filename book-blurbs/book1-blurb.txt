You have been told that talent is the key to success. That some people are simply born with gifts the rest of us lack.

This is one of the most dangerous lies in human history.

The Foundation of Mastery reveals the extraordinary science behind why repetition works -- and why everything you believed about talent, genius, and innate ability is wrong. You'll discover how your brain physically rewires itself every time you repeat an action. How myelination builds the speed and precision that separates amateurs from masters. How neuroplasticity means your brain never stops growing, at any age, in any domain.

The science is clear. The path is proven. And the only question is whether you are ready to walk it.
