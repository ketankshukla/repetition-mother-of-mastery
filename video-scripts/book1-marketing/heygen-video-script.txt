OVERVIEW FOR HEYGEN
=============================================================

You are producing a 3-minute portrait-format (9:16 vertical) marketing video for the book "The Foundation of Mastery" — Book 1 of the Repetition: Mother of Mastery series by Ketan Shukla.

Assets provided:
- Author logo (opening and closing asset)
- Book 1 cover image (shown briefly when the narrator mentions the book)

VIDEO FLOW:
LOGO (with music) → NARRATOR speaks full video with lower-third captions → BOOK COVER shown for 5 seconds when narrator first mentions the book → back to NARRATOR → near end, BOOK COVER shown again when narrator mentions the book → CALL TO ACTION → AUTHOR LOGO → fade to black

The narrator (AI avatar) is on screen for the entire video. No b-roll images. Lower-third captions appear throughout all narrator scenes. The book cover appears as a full-screen insert for exactly 5 seconds each time the narrator mentions the book, then cuts back to the narrator. All transitions are smooth cross-fades of 0.5 seconds.

VIDEO SCRIPT WITH SCENE CUE MARKERS
=============================================================

[SCENE 1 — Display: AUTHOR LOGO — duration: 5 seconds — no narration]

[SCENE 2 — NARRATOR on screen — lower-third captions active]
What if everything you have ever believed about talent is wrong?

What if the people you admire most — the athletes, the musicians, the brilliant minds who seem to operate on another level — what if they did not start with some gift you were never given? What if the real secret behind every extraordinary skill ever developed by a human being comes down to one word? Repetition.

[SCENE 3 — Display: BOOK COVER — duration: 5 seconds — narrator pauses, no narration]

[SCENE 4 — NARRATOR on screen — lower-third captions active]
This is The Foundation of Mastery, Book One of the Repetition: Mother of Mastery series by Ketan Shukla. Inside these pages, you will discover exactly what happens inside your brain every single time you repeat a skill. You will learn how neural pathways physically form and strengthen with each repetition — how your brain literally rewires itself through a process called Hebbian learning, where neurons that fire together wire together.

You will understand how a substance called myelin wraps around your nerve fibers every time you practice — making signals travel faster and with more precision, turning slow and clumsy movements into fast, fluid, effortless performance. This is not motivation. This is biology. This is the actual machinery of mastery happening inside your body every time you show up and do the work.

But it goes even deeper than that. You will discover neuroplasticity — your brain's infinite capacity to grow and reorganize itself at any age. It does not matter if you are twenty or sixty. Your brain is built to learn, to adapt, to master new skills for as long as you are alive. The only question is whether you give it the repetitions it needs.

And here is where this book separates itself from everything else you have read. It does not just tell you to practice more. It shows you the difference between deliberate practice and mindless repetition — and that difference is everything. Mindless repetition is going through the motions. Deliberate practice is focused, intentional, and targeted. This book lays out exactly how to practice deliberately so that every hour you invest delivers maximum results.

You will learn the four stages of competence — the predictable path that every human being walks from total ignorance to effortless mastery. You will understand exactly where you are on that path and what it takes to reach the next level.

You will discover the spacing effect — the scientific proof that distributing your practice over time produces dramatically better retention than cramming everything into marathon sessions.

You will learn why sleep is not wasted time but one of the most powerful tools in your mastery arsenal — because while you sleep, your brain is actively consolidating and strengthening every pattern you practiced during the day.

And you will master the art of feedback loops — the engine that transforms blind repetition into precision-guided growth, turning every practice session into a guaranteed step forward.

This book also confronts the psychology of persistence head on. The people who achieve mastery are not the ones who never wanted to quit. They are the ones who kept going anyway. This book shows you exactly how to develop persistence as a trainable skill — because that is precisely what it is.

[SCENE 6 — NARRATOR on screen — lower-third captions active — CALL TO ACTION]
The Foundation of Mastery is ten chapters of pure, evidence-based insight that will fundamentally rewire your understanding of human potential. After reading this book, you will never look at talent the same way again. You will see it for what it really is — the visible result of invisible repetitions, performed consistently, over time.
