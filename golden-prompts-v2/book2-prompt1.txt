A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT:
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-left quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly left of center). She is captured in a three-quarter close-up portrait looking to the right, her body angled toward the right side of the frame. Her expression is one of quiet determination — a confident, assured smile that says she has discovered that systems, not willpower, are the engine of lasting change. Her right hand rests lightly on her collarbone, fingers relaxed, a gesture of self-assurance and grounded confidence. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of pale golden freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, with individual hairs visible and slightly feathered at the inner corners. Her eyes are wide open and radiant — large, bright amber-brown irises with golden striations radiating outward from the pupil like rings of a tree, each striation a slightly different shade of honey and bronze. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, curved in a smile that conveys both determination and serenity. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — no vanity, only quiet strength and earned character. Her skin is bathed in warm golden light from above, creating luminous highlights on her forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her cheekbones, while soft shadows pool beneath her cheekbones and along the sides of her jaw. Every micro-detail is rendered — a tiny beauty mark near her left eyebrow, an almost invisible scar on her chin that speaks of a life lived fully, the way individual strands of her long auburn-brown hair catch the golden light like filaments of spun gold.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or hand may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — THE HABIT ENGINE:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a magnificent, impossibly intricate clockwork engine — a visual metaphor for the habit systems that drive human excellence. Dozens of interlocking golden gears of varying sizes fill the upper two-thirds of the image, each gear rendered in luminous polished gold with perfectly machined teeth. The gears are visibly turning in synchronized motion — small gears driving medium gears driving massive gears in an endless, perfectly coordinated mechanical dance. Each gear is engraved with fine repeating geometric patterns along its surface — identical concentric circles etched into the metal. At the center of the mechanism, a massive golden flywheel spins with unstoppable momentum, its rim glowing white-hot with kinetic energy — representing the compound effect of daily habits. Golden chains connect distant gears, each chain link identical to the next. Tiny golden sparks fly from where gear teeth mesh together. Between the gears, thin golden rods and pistons move in perfectly repeating strokes — visualizing the cue-routine-reward loop. The entire mechanism floats against a deep black background with warm amber atmospheric haze. Volumetric golden light streams through the gaps between gears, creating dramatic god-rays. Fine golden dust and particles float throughout the scene.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "THE REPETITION SERIES" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): "BOOK II" — Garamond font, centered, gold color (#D4A843), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal gold lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "THE HABIT ENGINE" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle gold warmth. "THE" is rendered noticeably smaller than "HABIT" and "ENGINE." "ENGINE" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE HABIT"
Line 4: "ENGINE"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant golden ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into delicate curving scrollwork and flourishes at the center, with symmetrical ornamental curls tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in warm gold (#D4A843) with subtle luminous glow. This line appears ABOVE the subtitle.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "Building Habits and the Journey to Excellence" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 28% from top): An identical golden ornamental filigree divider matching the one above — same scrollwork, same flourishes, same symmetrical design. This line appears BELOW the subtitle.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, powerful, warm golden tones against deep darkness. The feeling of witnessing the magnificent internal machinery of human habit — an engine of gold that, once set in motion by consistent repetition, generates unstoppable momentum toward excellence. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
