## ChatGPT / DALL-E Prompt

```
Create a photorealistic 1200×630 pixel Open Graph image for a non-fiction book series website called "Repetition: Mother of Mastery."

COMPOSITION:
A cinematic widescreen scene radiating outward from the center — depicting the journey from scientific understanding to the mastery of life through practice, habit, and dedication.

CENTER — THE WOMAN:
A young woman with warm brown hair, photographed from mid-chest up, stands at the center of the composition. She faces the viewer with a gentle, knowing smile, looking slightly upward. Her hands are cupped together at chest level, holding a radiant golden orb of light — a glowing sphere of concentrated energy and knowledge. Her eyes reflect wonder and quiet confidence. She wears a casual, understated dark top. Warm golden light emanates from the orb, illuminating her face from below.

ABOVE HER — THE NEURAL TREE:
Rising from the golden orb, a magnificent tree made entirely of glowing golden neural pathways and synaptic connections extends upward, its branches reaching toward the top of the frame. The tree is composed of spiraling golden light particles, interconnected nodes, and branching neural filaments — representing the brain's neuroplasticity and the physical transformation that repetition creates. The neural tree fills the upper portion of the image with warm, radiant golden light against a deep dark background.

LEFT SIDE — SYMBOLS OF PRACTICE:
Subtly visible in the warm golden atmosphere: a pianist at a grand piano (silhouetted), a person reading a book, calligraphy brush strokes flowing through the air. These represent the domains of mastery explored in the series. The lighting here is warm amber and gold.

RIGHT SIDE — SYMBOLS OF MASTERY:
On the right: a swimmer diving through golden water, an artist's palette with vibrant colors, geometric patterns representing cognitive frameworks, and a golden key floating among the light particles. These represent the transformation from practice to mastery. A glowing city skyline on the horizon suggests the integration of mastery into daily life.

CENTER-TOP — THE SERIES LOGO ELEMENT:
A circular medallion with an ornate golden frame, dark navy interior, and a golden spiral pattern with a decorative key at its center. Four amber gemstones at the cardinal points. Neural connection patterns in the frame's border. This medallion is semi-transparent, overlaid above the woman's head where the neural tree begins.

BOTTOM — TEXT OVERLAY in elegant serif typography:
Line 1 (large, in cream/ivory with gold shadow): "Repetition: Mother of Mastery"
Line 2 (smaller, in warm gold #d4a843): "A Five-Book Journey from Science to Mastery"
Line 3 (small, in gold with transparency): "by Ketan Shukla"

A thin ornamental gold line with a small decorative flourish separates the imagery from the text.

OVERALL STYLE:
Photorealistic, warm, luminous, and inspiring. The dominant color palette is deep black, warm amber, rich gold (#d4a843), and honey tones. The golden neural tree is the hero element — it should be the most visually striking feature. The mood is aspirational, scientific, and deeply human. Volumetric golden lighting with particles and light motes throughout. The overall feel is a premium non-fiction book series about human potential — warm, intelligent, and transformative.
