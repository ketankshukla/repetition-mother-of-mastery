A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover. A beautiful young white woman in her 20s dominates the frame in a close-up three-quarter portrait, filling at least 70% of the image. Her face is photorealistic with extraordinary detail — flawless yet natural skin with subtle pores and light freckles, full defined eyebrows, luminous eyes with visible iris detail and natural catchlights, soft natural lips. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates simplicity and humility — there is no vanity in her beauty, only quiet strength and earned character. Her face is tilted slightly upward, her expression radiant with the unshakable hope of someone who has climbed every step — who knows that every small daily habit compounds into something magnificent. Her eyes shine with the joy of upward momentum, her expression carrying the quiet triumph of someone who chose the stairs when everyone else waited for the elevator. Her skin is lit with warm golden light, every contour and shadow rendered with cinematic precision. Behind her and slightly out of focus, identical golden steps repeat endlessly upward in a perfect ascending pattern — each step exactly the same height, the same width, the same glow, stretching from the bottom of the image to the top and beyond, a visual anthem of repetition as the staircase to excellence. The lower portion is deep midnight blue, transitioning to warm gold and white at the top. Photorealistic style with volumetric lighting and atmospheric haze. At the very top, "THE REPETITION SERIES" in small elegant Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.15em, font size 14pt. Directly below, "BOOK II" in Garamond font, centered, gold, letter-spacing 0.2em, font size 12pt. Below that, title "THE HABIT ENGINE" in large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white. Subtitle "Building Habits and the Journey to Excellence" below in smaller Garamond, light gold. Author name "KETAN SHUKLA" at the bottom in large Garamond font, centered, generous letter spacing, white.
